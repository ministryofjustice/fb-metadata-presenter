# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]
### Added
### Changed
### Fixed

## [3.3.3] - 2023-11-21
### Added
- Baseline date year upper/lower bound validation to catch obvious typos / fat finger errors.
- Some errors in the uploader were not being properly handled. This is now fixed by introducing
  a catch-all validator.
### Fixed
- Ensure if there is not a concrete validator for a given error, we use a catch-all validator.
- Some error messages like the virus scan were not properly showing the filename when triggered 
  in a multiuploader component.
- Made the date validator more robust and in line with the submitter.

## [3.3.2] - 2023-11-16
 - Update the text in the session reset modal to only contain one line in order
   to pass WCAG accessibility criteria

## [3.3.1] - 2023-11-08
### Changed
- Updated the id attribute on content areas to enable tehm to be correcly
focused in the editor

## [3.3.0] - 2023-11-02
### Changed
- Use latest `json-schema` version (4.1.1) which performs (since version 3.0.0) validation of `const` attributes.
- Removed `_id` const in page schema as pages inherit already an `_id` of type string from `definition.data`
### Fixed
- Attribute `_type` (const) in _radios_, _checkboxes_ and _date_ components was being wrongly validated against a
  duplicated `_type` inherited from `definition.fieldset`. Removed this attribute from the fieldset definition.
- Added missing `page.exit` to list of allowed types in base schema.
